        ### Dataset Introduction
        In this project, I will analyze Amazon Sales Dataset. This dataset contains 1k+ pieces of specific information about Amazon products with product ids, prices, discounts, categories, customer reviews and other important details. Analyzing this Dataset will provide in-depth insights into market trends, consumer behavior, pricing strategies, and product performance to support more effective business decisions.
        ### Data Preprocessing Steps
        The following steps were taken to preprocess the dataset:

        - **Data Type Changes**: Converts variables such as price, percentage and rating from object type to numeric type. 
                If the variable is a mixture of numbers and units, we can first convert the variable to a string type, 
                delete the unit character and then convert it to a numeric type.
        - **Missing Value Handling**: Check and Drop rows with missing values.
        - **Create product Information Table**: Extract the columns related to product information from the table and construct a new table. 
                Extract main category and sub-category from 'category' variable respectively as new variables.
                Calculate the discount amount and percentage using actual_price and discount_price.
        - **Data Visualization and Analysis**: Visualize data such as product sales quantity, discounts, customer ratings and reviews, 
                analyze and evaluate the results of the visualizations.
        
        The data processing flowchart is shown below:

Further data is needed to assess the growth potential and competitive landscape of these categories.

            üí°For categories with lower quantities, Explore whether the low sales are due to product quality or marketing strategy. If the product sales do not increase significantly after improving quality and promotion, and the product is not a high-margin product, it might be worth assessing **whether to continue investing** in it.

                **Actual Price vs. Discounted Price:** With a correlation of 0.96, this indicates a very high positive correlation, suggesting that as the actual price increases, the discounted price also increases proportionally. This is expected as discounts are often a percentage of the actual price.

                **Rating Count vs. All Pricing Variables:** All correlations are very weak (ranging from -0.036 to 0.012), suggesting that the number of ratings a product receives is not strongly influenced by its price or the discount applied.

                The lack of a strong correlation between price and ratings indicates that customers **do not necessarily rate products based on how expensive they are or how much discount they receive**. Instead, other factors like quality, brand perception, and customer satisfaction are likely more influential on ratings.

            **Pricing Strategy:** By analyzing discount and pricing data, businesses can better understand how to price products to attract customers while maintaining profit margins.

            **Customer Satisfaction:** The analysis of ratings and review counts reveals which products and services are most favored by customers and which need improvement, helping businesses to optimize their product lines and service quality.

            **Market Trends:** Analysis of product category distributions shows which categories are most popular, aiding businesses in identifying opportunities for growth or adjustments needed in their market strategy.

            **Inventory and Supply Chain Management:** Understanding which product categories are most popular and have the largest discounts can help businesses better manage inventory and meet customer needs.

            **Consumer Behavior:** Keyword and correlation analysis provide in-depth understanding of consumer preferences and behavior, allowing businesses to tailor their marketing messages and improve product features.

            ‚ú®**Based on the previous graphical analyses, here are some detailed development suggestions for Amazon:**
                
            **Differentiated Competition:** Given the abundance and generally high ratings of products in electronics and home appliances, Amazon could collaborate with manufacturers to develop exclusive products or bundles, further differentiating its offerings in these saturated markets.
                
            **Dynamic Pricing Strategy:** With high-value items maintaining high price points even post-discount, Amazon should consider implementing a more dynamic pricing mechanism that adjusts prices and discounts in real-time based on market demand and inventory levels.
                
            **Enhanced Customer Feedback:** To increase the number of reviews and customer engagement, Amazon could offer small discounts or reward points to customers who leave valuable feedback, thereby encouraging more reviews.
            
            **Inventory Management:** For categories with a wide range of products but varied sales, Amazon should leverage advanced data analytics to optimize inventory, reducing overstock of slow-moving items while increasing stock for popular, well-rated products.
            
            **Focus on Customer Experience:** Key phrase analysis suggests Amazon should emphasize factors like "quality," "ease of use," and "value for money" in product descriptions, recommendations, and search algorithms to enhance the purchasing experience.
            
            **Strategic Discounts and Promotions:** Amazon could apply strategic discounts during specific periods (like holiday seasons) for products with high ratings but fewer reviews to increase sales and product visibility.
            
            **Data-Driven Marketing:** Amazon should use textual analysis of customer ratings and reviews to gain insights into market trends and adjust its marketing strategies accordingly, such as highlighting product features that customers care about in promotions.
