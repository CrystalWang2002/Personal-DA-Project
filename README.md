Currently, my website features two main projects: 'Amazon Sales Analysis' and 'Customer Behavior Analysis'.

In the 'Amazon Sales Analysis', I delve into the Amazon online retail dataset, exploring sales trends, customer behaviors, and market dynamics. Then I build a simple content-based recommendation system.

In the 'Customer Behavior Analysis' project, I Performed customer profiling and analysed influential factors of customers' purchasing behaviours. Finally I Provided suggestions for customer target, product inventory management, and marketing strategies, etc.
